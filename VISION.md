# Product Vision: Git for Prompts

**Tagline:** Version control, review, and test LLM prompts like code.

## The Problem

Teams can't version, review, or test LLM prompts like code. AI prompts are now as critical as code, but there's no proper workflow for managing them.

## The Solution

A git-native, developer-first tool that:
- Treats prompts as first-class repo artifacts (YAML/JSON + metadata)
- Fits into Git PRs and code review
- Provides CLI for prompt commits and diffs
- Runs deterministic tests across models
- Makes prompts portable across providers

**Analogy:** "GitHub for prompts + Travis CI for testing prompts"

---

## Core Features

### CLI + Dashboard
- `gitify-prompt commit` - Version prompts
- `gitify-prompt diff` - Side-by-side comparison
- `gitify-prompt test` - Run against test suites
- Web dashboard for team collaboration

### Git Integration
- Branching + review workflow (PRs for prompts)
- PR-style approvals
- CI integration (GitHub Actions)

### Multi-Provider Support
- Adapters for OpenAI, Anthropic, local LLMs
- Portable prompt format
- Test across multiple models

---

## Why This Wins

### 1. Git-Native Design
Most tools are SaaS silos. We integrate with existing dev workflows (repos, CI, IDEs).

### 2. Infrastructure Play
Not a notebook tool - actual infra with:
- Versioning
- Testing
- CI/CD for prompts
- Reproducible outputs

### 3. Developer-First UX
Bottom-up adoption via:
- CLI (foundational)
- IDE plugins (VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains)
- Browser extensions (ChatGPT, Claude)
- GitHub Action

---

## Market Landscape

**Existing Players:**
- **PromptLayer** - Logging & analytics (API request logging)
- **LangSmith** - Observability & evals (debugging AI flows)
- **Promptable** - Prompt builder UIs (not git-native)

**Gap We Fill:**
Full git-native workflow with versioning, PRs, CI, and cross-model testing. Nobody owns the "infra + git" combo yet.

---

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Prompt as Artifact

```yaml
prompt:
  id: user-onboarding-welcome
  content: |
    Write a friendly onboarding email for a new user…
  metadata:
    model: gpt-4o
    tags: [email, onboarding]
    tests: ["generate 3 outputs with no spelling mistakes"]
```

### 2. Layered Integration

**CLI / API (foundation):**
- `prompt commit`, `prompt diff`, `prompt test`
- Scriptable into pipelines

**IDE Plugins:**
- Inline "save prompt to repo" button
- "View past versions" → diff in IDE

**LLM Bridges:**
- Browser extensions (ChatGPT, Claude)
- Wrap local LLMs (ollama, lmstudio)

**Web Dashboard:**
- Search, review, tag prompts
- PR-style approvals

### 3. Provider Adapters

Prompts shouldn't be locked to one provider:
- Store: prompt + metadata (model, temperature, tokens)
- Run: OpenAI → Anthropic → Local → HuggingFace
- Test: regression suite across models

### 4. Tests + Reproducibility

**Core value = confidence:**
- Unit tests for prompts
- Snapshot outputs
- Deterministic replays (fixed seed + model version)
- Golden-output diffing (BLEU/ROUGE/embedding similarity)

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Capture Friction
**Issue:** People paste into ChatGPT and won't save
**Mitigation:** 1-click capture (extension), immediate value (test on save)

### Risk: Competition
**Issue:** LangSmith, Weights & Biases
**Mitigation:** Position as open, git-native, developer-first (not SaaS silo)

### Risk: Fragmentation
**Issue:** Prompts live everywhere
**Mitigation:** Adapters + "test across models" differentiator

### Risk: Cost
**Issue:** Testing across models is expensive
**Mitigation:** Caching, sample subsets, local LLMs, charge for premium runs

### Risk: Security
**Issue:** Prompts may contain secrets
**Mitigation:** Masking rules, on-prem deployment, encryption, policy enforcement

---

## Go-to-Market

### Phase 1: Developer Adoption
- GitHub Action + VS Code extension + CLI
- Developers adopt in repos first
- Viral via GitHub Marketplace

### Phase 2: Team Expansion
- Dashboard for collaboration
- PR review workflows
- Team analytics

### Phase 3: Enterprise
- SSO, on-prem hosting
- Compliance features
- Support contracts

### Partner Strategy
Integrate with (don't compete against):
- LangChain/LangSmith (evals & observability)
- PromptLayer (logging & analytics)
- Become the "git truth" layer they plug into

---

## Monetization

### Per-Seat SaaS
- Dashboard, PR checks, history, search
- Freemium developer tier

### Usage Add-ons
- Multi-model regression runs
- Long-term snapshot storage
- Premium adapters (on-prem connectors)

### Enterprise
- Per-repo or per-instance licensing
- VPC/on-prem deployment
- SLAs + support

**Benchmarks:** Similar to GitHub Actions, Snyk, Datadog pricing models.

---

## Defensibility / Moat

1. **Git-native UX** - Strong moat vs UI-only SaaS
2. **Network effects** - Marketplace of vetted prompts, community repos
3. **Integrations** - Become plumbing layer (not vice versa)
4. **Data moat** - Anonymized metrics on prompt regressions (privacy-first)

---

## Competitive Strategy

### Don't Compete On
- Analytics/logging (PromptLayer does this)
- LLM evals (LangSmith does this)

### Win On
- Git workflow (make prompt commit+PR feel like code)
- Capture ease (1-click from anywhere)
- Infrastructure positioning (not a notebook)

---

## Next Milestones

### MVP (Current State)
- ✅ CLI for prompt commits
- ✅ Git hooks (auto-capture Claude Code conversations)

## Success Metrics

**Developer Adoption:**
- Weekly active CLI users
- Repos with gitify-prompt initialized
- GitHub stars + forks

**Team Adoption:**
- Paid seats
- Active PR reviews on prompts
- CI runs per week

**Enterprise:**
- Annual contracts

- Partner integrations

---

## The Vision

**Make prompt engineering as rigorous as software engineering.**

Just like GitHub made code collaboration seamless and Travis CI made testing automatic, gitify-prompt makes prompt versioning, review, and testing a natural part of the dev workflow.

**End state:**
Every AI-first team runs `gitify-prompt init` in their repos, just like they run `git init`. Prompts become as reviewable, testable, and reliable as code.

---

**Target:** Become infrastructure - "the Stripe/GitHub of AI prompts"
